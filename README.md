# Calendar

Classic facility management issue:
   Worker need to enter flat because he needs to repait something or
   get some metering from a meter installed inside the flat.

Demo would look like this:
   Worker enters possible slots he has available in a calendar (one cal per property and company (with multiple workers). Tenants get a one time link that leads to the cal; they can see available slots and "book" them.

Details:
  + worker has to see all available properties
  + for all properties there is a separate calendar
  + worker choose a day and defines from-to hours of availibility, set of 30 minutes "available" events are created
  + tenant can see a property calendar where all selected by workers period are visible
  - tenant can select one of the periods where he will be in property
  - administrator can see a company calendar with all workers events combined
  + administrator can see list of properties and tenants living there
  + administrator can create a single-use link for tenant to access calendar
